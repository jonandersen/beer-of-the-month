Clicking "check in stock" will make the program check systembolagets website if the product is in stock. It in some case take some time. The default bolag is "Bantorget" in lund. We are planning to add support for multiple bolag.

Most bang for the buck finds as it sounds most alchol for the money. If you check beer, it will find the best cheapest beer. Same with wine. If you click both, it will check both. If you click beverage it will also check the booze.

You can set filters to filter out price, volume and alchol. For now it only works for beer and wine.
